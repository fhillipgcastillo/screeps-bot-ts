# Multi-Room Resource Harvesting Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for extending the Screeps bot's harvesting and hauling capabilities from single-room operations to multi-room resource collection. The implementation will enable creeps to safely and efficiently harvest resources from adjacent rooms while maintaining backward compatibility with existing single-room operations.

## Core Requirements
1. **Multi-room Harvesting**: Extend harvesters to consider resource nodes in adjacent rooms (1 level away: up, down, left, right) if accessible via exit points
2. **Multi-room Hauling**: Extend haulers to collect energy from nearby rooms and transport it back to the main room
3. **Safety First**: Prioritize rooms without hostile creeps/structures and completely avoid hostile rooms
4. **Resource Distribution**: Implement logic to prevent overcrowding by ensuring each harvester targets a different nearby resource node
5. **Hauler Optimization**: Haulers should cycle between different resource sources, prioritizing closer sources first
6. **Configurable Expansion**: Design the system with a configurable parameter for exploration depth (0 = current room only, 1 = adjacent rooms, etc.)

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Harvesting System
- **Single-room focused**: Harvesters only scan `creep.room.find(FIND_SOURCES)`
- **Target persistence**: Uses `creep.memory.sourceTarget` for consistent targeting
- **Anti-crowding logic**: Has `getNextClosestTarget` and `memorizedPrevTargets` functions
- **Stationary approach**: Harvesters drop energy for haulers to collect

### Existing Hauling System
- **Resource collection**: Focuses on dropped resources, tombstones, and ruins
- **Room-limited**: Only searches within `creep.room`
- **Target management**: Uses `creep.memory.resourceTarget` for persistence
- **Transfer logic**: Delivers to spawns, extensions, and containers

### Existing Multi-Room Foundation
- **Explorer role**: Provides room navigation utilities (`getExitRoomNames`, `findRoomExits`)
- **Room status checking**: Comments show `Game.map.getRoomStatus(roomName)` usage
- **Exit pathfinding**: Logic for finding and navigating to room exits

## Implementation Tasks
